About Amanpreet Kaur

I am a student at the University of Texas pursuing my master's degree in Social Data Analytics and Research. I am a first generation student and the first to graduate in my family with a bachelor's degree in the United States. EPPS 6302 is the first course taught by Professor Karl Ho that I have taken so far.
