    "text": "Assignment #1:\nThe podcast episode from Dataframed that I chose to review is titled “How to have a Career in Data Science in 2025.” This interview is with Dawn Choo, the co-founder of Interview Master which is a platform that is designed to streamline technical interview preparation. \nOne of the first major points Choo addresses is the concern of AI replacing data science jobs. She claims that she has actually seen an increase in the demand for data science roles because of AI, and that there is an increasing amount of data scientists who are now taking part in creating AI products which is leading to more demand. Choo then explains how she uses AI regularly for efficient workflow. Some ways for using AI include writing basic code, structuring emails or other forms of communication, and doing basic research on topics. Choo then reflects on what is the difference between the similar sounding job titles in the data science field. She emphasizes that data engineers comprise the most fundamental layer since they write the code that builds out the “data ecosystem.” Then we have analytics engineers, who are similar to data engineers except that they have increased product and business knowledge. Lastly, she mentions data or business analysts who have similar responsibilities. After discussing the differences in the positions, Choo gives insight into the tools she recommends learning in order to be successful in the field. She believes that learning Python, SQL, and a foundational understanding of statistics is of great importance. For most data science roles, knowing the basics of machine learning is good enough, however, for those who want to specialize in machine learning or engineering, there needs to be an increased effort in learning beyond the basics. Regarding soft skills, Choo claims that having product and business sense is necessary alongside communication. Showcasing all these skills well to potential employers is important to understand. According to Choo, if you are transitioning to your first data science role, then you need to communicate effectively and demonstrate your soft skills from past projects or professional experience. This can be done with a nice portfolio which would be a repository of your projects. \nThe rest of the interview discusses topics like the typical hiring process, how to upskill, and what to look forward to in the world of AI. Overall, this podcast episode was insightful and gave me a lot to think about regarding how to improve my chances in securing a data science role. I also learned that while knowing how to use AI is not an immediate requirement right now, there is an unspoken need for it to be efficient in this field."
